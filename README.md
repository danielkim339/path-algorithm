# Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation 
This pathfinding visualization project demonstrates the difference between four popular graph searching algorithms. They all utilized concepts of graph theory to and although the visualization may seem simply, the algorithms driving the code are relevant to biomedical networks, automation, data mining, and many more processes. 

For proper execution of the code, look at the followng files:
- Pipfile shows the 3rd-party packages used and required to run the project. 
- requirements.txt shows the names and versions of all the build-in and 3rd party packages used to develop the project.

To run the code:
- Ensure python version 3.6 is running (required for pygame)
- Check if all 3rd-party packages are present
- Clone the repository
- Run the game.py file
